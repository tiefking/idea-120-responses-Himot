# Contemporary Gesamtkunstwerk 
A contemporary tool that could be used to make something that is gesamtkunstwerk is any video editing software.
Whether it be something simple like Windows Movie Maker or Adobe Premiere Pro, it really depends on how you use the tools you have.
A video editing software would be good to make a gesamtkunstwerk piece because a film can incorporate many art forms to create something
cohesive and harmonious. You can design wonderful set pieces, and carefully crafted costumes, and along with skilled actors and sound
design, you can have a film that draws in entirely. Or you can make a more abstract piece, animate either digitally or traditionally,
itâ€™s almost limitless. And being skilled with video editing software it is possible to mix different art forms to make something that
can be considered gesamtkunstwerk.

I believe Versions (2010) of the Rhizome Anthology could be considered as a gesamtkunstwerk. This piece utilizes several mediums.
There is a mix of different visual types, from 3D to 2D, from still images or animated. The audio is a mix of the artists' own words
and words recycled from other sources, made cohesive by using a computerized voice tool.
