I don’t believe Murray’s predictions were correct beyond television and the internet being more interconnected, though technically the internet has beat out television. Her vision leaned heavily into the interactive video game aspect, and exploring the world of television characters, which is not at all shows of current times. Shows still rely on a script, and viewers simply view it. Compared to the LED sets of the Mandalorian, I feel as if Murray’s prediction missed the mark. The LED set allowed for the actor to have a more realistic sense of the “reality” of the story they were in, and have a better idea of how post production would look compared to green screen. To viewers the settings looked more realistic through more accurate lighting, and the backgrounds moving at a different rate than the actors as if they were on a set or location. Though we aren’t at interactive shows yet, maybe eventually we’ll get to that point.
