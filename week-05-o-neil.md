An example of a  WMD could be the criminal justice system, mainly in the case of policing and arrests. The idea of these systems are to keep the general populace safe, and reduce criminals. But it is also a very rigid system that doesn’t change, or at least hasn’t changed enough.

Despite there being police that does not mean crime will be reduced, or areas will be any safer. The police don’t solve the issue, they simply congregate more to areas where there is more crime. Which is often POC neighborhoods, and this system makes it appear as if that’s just where crime tends to happen more. This does not get to the root of the actual problem, which is crime happens a lot more in places with higher poverty, where people don’t have the means to support themselves within legal means. This poverty leads to work opportunities moving elsewhere, poor schooling, and other things that could push somebody towards less legal means of getting by.

The core issues aren’t being addressed as they should. And the problems repeat themselves since other causes aren’t factored into it. And then when arrested individuals are let back out, they still have no means to support themselves. And their criminal background makes them even less likely to get a job, so once again they will turn to crime.
