I think an online ad for pedigree chickens would be interpreted in a different medium. The linguistic message would be the name of the chicken breed, and possibly the name of the chicken if the advertiser gave it one. The pure image would be a chicken. The symbolic meaning could be that usually these chickens presented outside or in a coop of sorts. This could be to show off the chickenâ€™s health and give this sense that the chickens were well taken care of. Showing that this seller is a trusted one.
