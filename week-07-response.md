I agree with the issues that Bridle lays out, there is definitely a lot of strange and dangerous content out there that is easily accessed by children. And the fact that it can be produced without any human intervention is also troubling, as things can be sent out and nobody would ever know.

I also agree with his solution, to shut down the system. The internet has evolved from the way it was before, and systems like Youtube are so large and interwoven now. Youâ€™d have to shut down the whole system and overhaul it all at once, the problems are too deep set to fix things bit by bit. Youtube has taken measures to prevent disturbing kids videos that plagued it a few years ago, but there are still many disturbing things and content farms that thrive anyhow. It has just adapted to a slightly different system.
