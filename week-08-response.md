When it comes to consuming media on the internet I believe that we are exposed to exploitative advertising. A lot of these advertisements use your own data against you, showing you things you need or you think you need. And can oftentimes use misleading data to convince potential consumers, large companies are obligated to have truthful advertisements but they don’t always do, or manipulate the truth to make goods or services more appealing.

Having targeted ads can be helpful, but the advertisers have to be more truthful with the product or service they are providing. And if you are trying to sell a product, and you know it's not good, telling people it isn't worth their money means the product won’t sell. But this might encourage more quality services, who knows. But as long as companies can so easily twist the truth so far, or completely lie in some cases, targeted ads can easily be turned predatory.
